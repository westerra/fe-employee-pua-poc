# Employee App Angular Project

This is the Angular workspace for your Backbase Employee App.

The app itself can be found in `projects/employee-app`.

## Getting started

Run `npm install` to install dependencies, then:

- `npm run start` to start a local dev server
- `npm run update` to update to the latest version of the Employee App

See the [app README](./projects/employee-app/README.md) for more details on the above and other commands, as
well as instructions for working with the app itself.
