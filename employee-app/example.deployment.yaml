#
# EXAMPLE KUBERNETES OBJECT DEFINITIONS
#
# This file contains examples of how you could define some kubernetes objects to deploy and
# configure your employee web app container in your kubernetes cluster.
#
# In particular, the Deployment yaml below contains environment variables which can be used
# to configure identity integration and the api base path. See also the ./Dockerfile and
# ./src/environments/environment.prod.docker.ts files for details on how these variables are applied.
